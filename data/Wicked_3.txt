As remarkable as the performances are-both Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande truly shine throughout the film (particularly Grande's Glinda, whose maturity and emotional depth anchor much of this second half)-Wicked: Part Two ultimately lacks the strength and cohesion of its predecessor.

Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Jeff Goldblum, and Michelle Yeoh all deliver standout performances, finally given the space to demonstrate why their casting mattered-something Part One failed to fully achieve for its supporting ensemble. On a technical level, the production design, makeup, costume design, and visual effects remain top-tier, matching the quality and ambition of the first installment. Cinematography is improved compared to Part 1.

However, while Part One stands firmly on its own-filled with the stronger musical numbers, color, and humor that have long defined the land of Oz-this second chapter feels more supplementary than essential for casual viewers. The editing and screenplay choices often prevent key musical moments such as "Thank Goodness" and "Wonderful" from reaching their full impact, trimming them so heavily that their magic is somewhat lost.

Conversely, several numbers receive impressive upgrades-"No Good Deed," "For Good," and "As Long As You're Mine" emerge as highlights, likely to leave audiences humming on their way out of the theater. It's during "I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)" that Grande's performance truly ascends, signaling the start of what could be an awards-worthy portrayal, rich in vulnerability and command.

In the end, while Part Two is undeniably flawed, it remains as enchanting as its material allows, offering moments of genuine wonder even as it falters under inevitable comparison to its predecessor. Despite its uneven pacing, this adaptation manages to refine and elevate many aspects of the Broadway source-ensuring that audiences will still leave the theater satisfied, their hearts light, and their spirits touched by a bit of Oz's timeless magic.
