Jon Favreau is Chef Carl Casper working in a restaurant for a boss he doesn't see eye to eye with. He ends up leaving his job after he becomes fed up with the menu and receiving some bad criticism from a food critic. He exchanges insults with the food critic via Twitter and of course it goes viral and Carl's reputation is really on the line. He's also having some problems with his own personal life after he and his wife split and he is trying to build a relationship with his young son. The story follows Carl as he looks to get his career back on track and build stronger bonds with his loved ones.

The whole cast was very likable and easy to relate to, Carl and Tony had a very funny working relationship and are then joined by Carl's son, Percy when they get the food truck going. Then we have smaller roles for Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Dustin Hoffman and Sofia Vergara...some cast list that.

This is certainly a feel good film, I couldn't help but smile when watching. There was some lovely looking food on display and a great soundtrack to boot. Although it was mostly a comedy (and it was pretty hilarious in places) the film also had some heated arguments for dramatic effect, I felt this worked really well to show the viewer just what the characters are going through. Overall it was just a fun, unique film.

A really enjoyable film, heartwarming, feel good fun, one of the best films of 2014. 9/10.
