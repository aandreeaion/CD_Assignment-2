Wicked: For Good defies gravity and exceeds expectations set by Part One. The character arcs are expanded and deepened, the cinematography and directing builds a "calm before the storm" energy that will leave you glued to the screen, and the set design and costuming/makeup truly brings the whole story together for good!

Performances by the entire cast left me with goosebumps, especially those of Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. The Oscar campaign for these actresses is going to be wild and BOTH deserve to walk away with their WELL-EARNED awards in their respective categories. The buildup of their stories coincide in a beautiful and painful way that left me turning away with tears that refused to stop.

And I, of course, HAVE to mention the INSANE tension between Marissa Bode's and Ethan Slater's on-screen chemistry. The deep layers of Nessarose and Boq were visible in ways unexplainable by words, but more so through the feeling I had running up my spine.

When it comes to the vocal performances of the soundtrack, Thank Goodness and NO GOOD DEED truly stood out to me. Cynthia is an absolute powerhouse and had the entire audience erupting in cheers and applause.

When it came to the second half of the film, it was definitely faster paced while still allowing key moments to have their centerstage spotlight. And of course, we have the crossover with The Wizard of Oz that fortunately does not steal away from the core of the film. Jon M. Chu, you are a GENIUS. I truly enjoyed how many off-stage moments were expanded in this film and allowed for many narratives to be dived deeper into.

And then there's For Good...holy shiz. I was crying for half the song and then immediately after all the way until the end of the film. There's also ONE scene that was not rushed and gutted my heart out in ways I can't even explain.

All in all, it's an astounding conclusion to a beloved franchise. I am truly changed for good.
